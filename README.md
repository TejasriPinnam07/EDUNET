# ðŸŽ¨ Dominant Color Detection in Images using KMeans

This project identifies and displays the dominant colors present in an image using KMeans clustering â€” a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It can be used for color palette extraction, image summarization, and design applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

Automatically extract the most dominant colors from input images to assist in design automation, content tagging, and visual analysis. This project demonstrates how unsupervised ML can be applied to real-world image processing tasks.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn (KMeans)
